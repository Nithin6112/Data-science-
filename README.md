This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes. By analyzing a dataset(diamonds.csv) that includes information about the carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and other factors, we aim to create a model(regression,gradient and random forest) that can accurately estimate the price of diamonds.![Anglo-DiamondAnatomy_03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20dd6955-8344-4b40-a5fc-d2abc3d09667)
